# watchX Blocks
watchX Blocks is a visual programming editor for watchX. It is based on the Google's [Blockly][1] and Carlos Pereira Atencio's [Ardulockly][18]. This project is forked directly from Ardublockly.

The project is relatively new and still a "work in progress", this readme and other files and filenames will be edited in the upcoming days and weeks.


## Features
* Generates Arduino code with visual drag-and-drop blocks
* Uploads the code to watchX
* Uploads hex files to watchX
* Useful "code block warnings"
* Works on Windows / Linux / Mac OS X

watchX Blocks is still under development. A to-do list will be released soon.

You will also need the [Arduino IDE version 1.6.x or higher][2].
