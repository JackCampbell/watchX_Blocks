watchX Blocks is a visual coding editor for watchX. It is based on the Google's [Blockly][1] and Carlos Pereira Atencio's [Ardublockly][18]. This project is forked directly from Ardublockly and developed further on by the argeX team.

The project is relatively new and still a "work in progress", this readme and other files and filenames will be edited in the upcoming days and weeks.

You can find more information about the watchX from [here][18].
